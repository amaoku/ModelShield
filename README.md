# ModelShield

Code and datasets for our paper on language model IP protection watermark.
Still being updated, more content coming soon.

##Dependencies
Only the model training phase needs to take the environment into consideration. [ Requirement](https://github.com/amaoku/ModelShield/blob/master/Imitation_Model_training/train/requirements.txt)

## Watermark Generation
We use system instructions to guide the generation of watermarks in language models.

## Imitation Model training
fine-tuning imitation model with watermarked data.

## Watermark Verification
We offer two methods for watermark verification:
1. Rapid Verification
2. Detailed Verification

## Dataset
- HC3
- WILD
